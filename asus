I was looking for a laptop for my girlfriend, she likes numpad and DVD Drive laptops.
In late 2009 I bought my first laptop (UL30A-A2) and ASUS it's great with all products 
and I was more than happy with the performance, stylish and specs, so ASUS is the way to go for the new laptop. 

When I found this product I liked all the specs but look especially for the reviews and I bought the laptop based 
on only one great review available by SpaceDoll. Amazon does great job with the delivery, I ordered on saturday 
July 30 and I have it on my hands on monday morning.

- Laptop cover is very shine, I like the circuits style.
- I removed all stickers on the inside, Intel Core i5 sticker is the hardest to remove hehe.
- The mousepad is great, it's very soft when you touch it.
- Mousepad has two finger touch used to scroll and three finger for middle click.
- The keyboard layout is great and numpad enter + fn, opens the calculator.
- Screen resolution is great, laptop box says "15.6 GL, LED" but Amazon product says "15.6 HD", anyway very good graphics.
- Laptop runs silently and very cold, no fan noise.
- Ubuntu 11.04 was installed too, I impressed with 3 minutes system install time. It took more time to download packages.
- (Ubuntu) Unity works and looks really good at the first login.
- Ubuntu 11.04 power on ready to use in 15 seconds and shutdown in 4 seconds.

- Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bits is preinstalled, personally I do not like nor use Windows.

I will update the review in few days after more and more using.

Highly recommended ASUS A53E-XE2!
